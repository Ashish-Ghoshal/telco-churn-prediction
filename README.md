## Overview

This project focuses on building a robust machine learning solution to predict customer churn within a telecommunications company. Customer churn, the phenomenon where customers stop using a company's services, is a significant challenge for businesses, directly impacting revenue and growth. By leveraging historical customer data, this project develops and evaluates various classification models to identify customers who are highly likely to churn. The insights gained from these predictions enable the company to implement proactive, targeted retention strategies, thereby minimizing customer attrition and enhancing long-term profitability. This repository showcases a complete, end-to-end machine learning pipeline, encompassing detailed data preprocessing, comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), rigorous model training with hyperparameter tuning, in-depth performance evaluation, and crucial model interpretability using SHAP.

## Key Features

This project provides a comprehensive set of functionalities designed for effective churn prediction:

*   Data Preprocessing: A meticulously crafted pipeline handles common data issues, including the identification and treatment of missing values, appropriate conversion of data types (e.g., converting 'TotalCharges' from object to numeric), robust scaling of numerical features using `StandardScaler`, and efficient encoding of categorical variables via `OneHotEncoder`. This ensures the data is in an optimal format for model consumption.
    
*   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Extensive visual and statistical analyses are performed to gain deep insights into the dataset. This includes visualizing data distributions, uncovering correlations between various customer attributes, and explicitly examining the relationship between different service types, contract durations, and the likelihood of churn.
    
*   Multiple Classification Models: To ensure a robust and comparative analysis, the project implements and rigorously compares the performance of several widely-used machine learning classification models. These include Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers, providing a well-rounded view of different algorithmic strengths.
    
*   Hyperparameter Tuning: Model performance is meticulously optimized through the application of RandomizedSearchCV. This technique efficiently explores a predefined hyperparameter space to identify the best combination of parameters for each model, maximizing their predictive accuracy and generalization capabilities.
    
*   Comprehensive Evaluation: The trained models undergo a thorough evaluation using a suite of standard classification metrics. This includes a confusion matrix (to visualize True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, False Negatives), accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under Curve), and Precision-Recall curve. These metrics provide a holistic view of model effectiveness across different performance aspects.
    
*   Threshold Optimization: Beyond default settings, the project discusses and demonstrates a pragmatic approach to choosing an optimal classification threshold. This critical step allows for tailoring the model's output to specific business needs, for instance, prioritizing recall to minimize missed churners even if it means a slight increase in false positives.
    
*   Model Interpretability (SHAP): To move beyond black-box predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is integrated. This powerful technique provides transparent insights into feature importance, revealing which factors are most influential in the model's overall predictions and how individual features contribute to specific churn predictions.
    
*   Modular Codebase: The entire codebase is designed with modularity in mind, organized into reusable Python scripts (`data_preprocessing.py`, `model_training.py`, `evaluation.py`, `predict.py`). This enhances clarity, facilitates maintenance, and promotes code reusability for future projects.
    
*   Google Colab Workflow: For ease of use, experimentation, and cloud-based execution, a dedicated, step-by-step Google Colab notebook is provided. This notebook mirrors the local project structure, allowing users to quickly set up, run, and explore the pipeline without complex local configurations.

## Setup and Execution

Follow these step-by-step instructions to set up the project environment and execute the machine learning pipeline locally on your machine.

### 1\. Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using Git. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

    git clone https://github.com/Ashish-Ghoshal/telco-churn-prediction.git
    cd telco-churn-prediction
    
    

### 2\. Download the Dataset

The project relies on the Telco Customer Churn dataset. Please download it from its official source:

Telco Customer Churn Dataset on Kaggle

Once downloaded, place the WA\_Fn-UseC\_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv file into the designated data/raw/ directory within your newly cloned repository. Ensure the file name is exact.

### 3\. Create and Activate Conda Environment

It is highly recommended to use a dedicated Conda environment to manage project dependencies. This isolates the project's requirements, preventing conflicts with other Python projects on your system.

    conda create -n telco_churn_env python=3.9
    conda activate telco_churn_env
    
    

This command creates a new Conda environment named `telco_churn_env` with Python 3.9 and then activates it, making it your active Python environment for this project.

### 4\. Install Dependencies

With your Conda environment activated, install all the necessary Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    

This command will automatically download and install all required packages (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, shap, joblib, matplotlib, seaborn).

### 5\. Run the Project

Once all dependencies are installed, you can execute the entire machine learning pipeline by running the main script.

    python main.py
    
    

This script will sequentially perform the following actions:

*   Load and Preprocess Data: It will read the `WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv` dataset, handle missing values, convert data types, perform feature scaling, and encode categorical variables, preparing the data for model training.
    
*   Train and Tune Models: It will train Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost models, applying `RandomizedSearchCV` for effective hyperparameter tuning to optimize each model's performance.
    
*   Evaluate Models: All trained models will be thoroughly evaluated on unseen test data, generating a suite of performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
    
*   Generate SHAP Plots: For the best-performing model, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) plots will be generated to provide critical insights into feature importance and how various factors influence churn predictions.
    
*   Save Outputs: The trained machine learning models (as `.joblib` files) will be saved to the `models/` directory. All evaluation results, classification reports, confusion matrices, and insightful plots (like ROC-AUC and SHAP visualizations) will be saved to the `results/` directory for easy access and review.
    

## How to Use and Interpret Results

After successfully running `main.py`, the `models/` and `results/` directories will be populated with the outputs of the machine learning pipeline.

*   `models/` directory: This directory contains the serialized (`.joblib`) files for all trained models (e.g., `logistic_regression_model.joblib`, `random_forest_model.joblib`). These files allow you to load and reuse the trained models without retraining them. The `preprocessor.joblib` file is also saved here, crucial for preprocessing new data before making predictions with the saved models.
    
*   `results/` directory: This is where all the analytical outputs and visualizations are stored:
    
    *   `classification_summary.csv`: A concise CSV file providing a comparative overview of key evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC) for all trained models.
        
    *   `classification_report_[model_name].txt`: Detailed text files, one for each model, containing a comprehensive classification report that breaks down precision, recall, and F1-score per class (churn vs. no-churn), along with support.
        
    *   `confusion_matrix_[model_name].png`: Visual representations of the confusion matrix for each model, showing the counts of True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, and False Negatives. These are vital for understanding the types of errors made by each model.
        
    *   `roc_auc_curve.png`: A single plot displaying the ROC-AUC curves for all models on the same graph, allowing for easy visual comparison of their ability to discriminate between churners and non-churners across different classification thresholds.
        
    *   `precision_recall_curve.png`: A single plot showing the Precision-Recall curves for all models, which is particularly informative for imbalanced datasets and when balancing the cost of False Positives and False Negatives is important.
        
    *   `shap_summary_plot_[model_name].png`: A global SHAP summary plot for the best-performing model. This plot illustrates the overall feature importance, showing which features have the most significant impact on the model's predictions and whether they tend to drive predictions towards or away from churn.
        
    *   `shap_dependence_plot_[feature_name]_[model_name].png`: Individual SHAP dependence plots for the top influential features of the best model. These plots reveal how the value of a single feature impacts the prediction, often highlighting non-linear relationships or interactions.
        

### Interpreting Results:

*   Classification Report: Provides a detailed breakdown of model performance for each class.
    
    *   Precision: Answers: "Of all customers predicted to churn, how many actually churned?" High precision means fewer false alarms.
        
    *   Recall: Answers: "Of all customers who actually churned, how many did the model correctly identify?" High recall means fewer missed churners.
        
    *   F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both.
        
*   Confusion Matrix: A visual representation of correct and incorrect predictions:
    
    *   True Positives (TP): Correctly predicted churners.
        
    *   True Negatives (TN): Correctly predicted non-churners.
        
    *   False Positives (FP): Predicted churners, but they did not churn (false alarms).
        
    *   False Negatives (FN): Predicted non-churners, but they actually churned (missed churners). For churn prediction, FNs are often more costly, as the company loses a customer without intervention.
        
*   ROC-AUC Curve: Plots the True Positive Rate (Recall) against the False Positive Rate at various threshold settings.
    
    *   A higher Area Under the Curve (AUC) indicates a better overall ability of the model to distinguish between churning and non-churning customers. An AUC of 1.0 is a perfect model, 0.5 is random.
        
*   Precision-Recall Curve: Plots Precision against Recall at various threshold settings.
    
    *   This curve is especially valuable for imbalanced datasets where the minority class (churners) is of primary interest. A high area under the PR curve indicates good performance on the positive class.
        
*   Threshold Selection: The default classification threshold is 0.5 (if probability > 0.5, predict churn). However, by examining the Precision-Recall curve, you can strategically choose a different threshold based on business objectives. For instance, if the cost of missing a churner (FN) is very high, you might lower the threshold to increase recall, even if it slightly reduces precision (more FPs). Conversely, if the cost of false intervention (FP) is high, you might increase the threshold to prioritize precision.
    
*   SHAP Plots: These plots provide explainability into the model's decisions:
    
    *   Summary Plot: Each point on the plot represents a Shapley value for a feature and an instance. Features are ordered by their overall importance. Color indicates feature value (e.g., red for high, blue for low). It helps identify which features generally drive predictions up (towards churn) or down (away from churn).
        
    *   Dependence Plots: Illustrate how the value of a single feature interacts with other features to impact the model's prediction, often revealing non-linear relationships or interactions.
        

## Future Enhancements

To make this project even more robust, scalable, and valuable in a real-world, resume-worthy context, consider implementing the following enhancements:

*   Advanced Feature Engineering:
    
    *   Create Interaction Features: Develop new features by combining existing ones that might have synergistic effects (e.g., `MonthlyCharges / tenure` to represent average monthly cost over a customer's lifetime; interaction terms between internet service type and streaming services).
        
    *   Temporal Features: If time-series data or more frequent data points become available, extract features like trend, seasonality, or recent activity spikes.
        
    *   Sophisticated Encoding: Explore advanced categorical encoding techniques such as Target Encoding, CatBoost Encoder, or Weight of Evidence (WOE) Encoding. These methods can capture more nuanced relationships within high-cardinality categorical features compared to simple One-Hot Encoding.
        
*   More Sophisticated Hyperparameter Optimization:
    
    *   Bayesian Optimization: Move beyond `RandomizedSearchCV` to more efficient global optimization techniques like Bayesian Optimization (e.g., using libraries like `hyperopt` or `Optuna`). These methods build a probabilistic model of the objective function, allowing them to intelligently choose the next best hyperparameters to evaluate, leading to faster and potentially better optimization.
        
    *   Nested Cross-Validation: Implement nested cross-validation for a more robust and less biased estimation of model performance, especially when extensive hyperparameter tuning is performed.
        
*   Ensemble Methods and Stacking:
    
    *   Advanced Gradient Boosting: Experiment with other high-performance gradient boosting frameworks like LightGBM and CatBoost, which are often faster and more accurate than standard XGBoost on certain datasets.
        
    *   Model Stacking/Ensembling: Build a meta-model that combines the predictions of multiple base models. This "stacking" approach can often lead to superior predictive performance by leveraging the strengths of diverse algorithms.
        
*   Imbalanced Class Handling (if applicable):
    
    *   While the current dataset is relatively balanced, real-world churn datasets often suffer from extreme class imbalance (churners are a small minority). Implement techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), ADASYN, or explore more advanced methods to create synthetic samples of the minority class. Alternatively, adjust class weights directly within model training algorithms to penalize misclassifications of the minority class more heavily.
        
*   Deployment and MLOps Integration:
    
    *   Containerization with Docker: Package the entire application (code, dependencies, and trained models) into a Docker container. This ensures consistent execution across different environments (development, testing, production).
        
    *   REST API Deployment: Deploy the trained model as a REST API using frameworks like Flask or FastAPI. This allows other applications or services to send new customer data and receive real-time churn predictions, transforming the model from an analytical tool to an operational asset.
        
    *   MLOps Tools Integration: Integrate with MLOps platforms and tools such as MLflow for experiment tracking (logging parameters, metrics, and models), DVC (Data Version Control) for versioning datasets and models, and Kubeflow for orchestrating end-to-end machine learning pipelines in Kubernetes.
        
*   Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
    
    *   Set up automated CI/CD pipelines (e.g., using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or Jenkins). This automates the process of testing code changes, retraining the model on new data, validating its performance, and deploying updated models to production environments, ensuring the model remains accurate and up-to-date.
        
*   Deep Learning Models:
    
    *   For significantly larger datasets or scenarios with highly complex, non-linear patterns that traditional ML models struggle with, explore using neural networks (e.g., with frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch). This would involve designing appropriate network architectures for tabular data.
        
*   Interactive Dashboard:
    
    *   Create an interactive web-based dashboard (using frameworks like Streamlit, Dash, or a custom Flask/React application with visualization libraries like D3.js or Plotly). This dashboard could allow business users to:
        
        *   Input new customer data and get real-time churn predictions.
            
        *   Visualize churn risk across different customer segments.
            
        *   Explore feature importance and individual prediction explanations (e.g., integrating SHAP plots directly into the dashboard).
            
        *   Track model performance over time.
